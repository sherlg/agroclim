#' Length of the Frost Period (Guaranteed Frost Days)
#' 
#' @description Calculates the number of days where the daily mean temperature is less than a threshold within a predefined period.
#' @param mn A numeric vector of daily minimum temperature series.
#' @param mx A numeric vector of daily maximum temperature series.
#' @param dates A vector of dates corresponding with daily temperature series.
#' @param iniday first day of the growing season, in text format ("mm-dd"). Defaults to `07-01`.
#' @param endday last day of the growing season, in text format ("mm-dd"). Defaults to `06-30`.
#' @param thres A numeric value indicating the temperature threshold considered to trigger frost occurrence (0 by default).
#' 
#' @return A numeric vector with the number of frost days (days where mean temperature is below the threshold) per season is returned.
#' 
#' @details Despite the logical threshold of temperature is 0 ÂºC to determine frost occurrence, the argument "thres" is open to 
#' change in case of different units of temperature.
#' Only complete seasons are included in the analysis, except for the last one. If the first season does not contain all required 
#' days (based on start and end indices), it is excluded from the results. The last season, however, is included even if it is 
#' not complete, and the data is analyzed up to the last available date provided in the indices.
