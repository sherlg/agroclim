#' Frost Probability for a Specific Day
#' 
#' @description Calculates the probability of frost occurrence on a specific calendar day across 
#' all available years, based on daily minimum temperature records and a specified temperature threshold.
#' @param mn A numeric vector of daily minimum temperature series.
#' @param dates A vector of dates corresponding with daily temperature series.
#' @param thres A numeric value indicating the temperature threshold considered to trigger frost occurrence (0 by default).
#' @param day A character string representing the calendar day in "mm-dd" format.
#' 
#' @return
#' A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the frost probability is returned.
#' 
#' @details A frost is defined as a day when the minimum temperature is below the specified threshold.
#' The probability of frost on a given day is computed as:
#' 
#' ph = (Number of years with frost (<0ÂºC) on that day) / (Total number of years with data for that day)
#'
